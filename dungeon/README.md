Adapted from <a href="https://github.com/dylanmc/SQLiteDungeon">Dylan's Dungeon</a> code from Spring 2019 Operating systems. 
Written in Python with SQLite3 as back-end. Image on right from RPG Maker VX with my character sprite in a designed dungeon map. This dungeon has rooms and exits. You can <i>spawn</i> a monster, <i>place</i>  loot, <i>take</i>  loot, and engage in combat with the monsters inside the dungeon. Users with a shovel in their inventory can <i>dig</i>  rooms. 

`Monster:` minotaur, orc, plant, rat, ogre, scorpion, skeleton, slime, snake, succubus, werewolf, zombie, skeleton, vampire, chimera, cerberus, spider, ghost, fairy, dragon `Loot:` plain-chest,golden-chest,steel-chest,mini-chest,mana-crystal,potion,book,tome,ring,shovel,herb,shield `Weapons:` sword,pick-axe,bow,dagger,spear,claw,crossbow `Classes:` hero, warrior, mage, priest `Skills:` attack,guard,double-attack,triple-attack,heal `States:` knockout,rage,confusion,sleep,immortal,blind,rage,normal,dead

Rooms are connected to each other by exits. An exit from a room has a
direction, which can be any single word, but should be something that
sounds like a direction (e.g., north, south, up, down, northeast,
etc.). Exits are uni-directional.

A player has a collection of stats: a weapon, an armor item of choice, a health parameter (mana),a state, and a class. If the player
loses all her mana she will not be able to move around the dungeon anymore. The default class is `hero`. You can only change your class
by finding certain items. 

Combat is simple: the player has an *attack-power* (ATP) level and a *defend-power* (DEF) level. You can increase either one through combat experience or by gaining items in the rooms.  

Only users with a <b>Monster Crystal</b> in their inventory can spawn monsters. Similarly, a player must have a shovel in her inventory to dig 
new rooms. <img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/f2247a7bd787d0d0d3584a9df5a91964/tumblr_pq80wrkP4R1tk06jno1_640.png" height="100" width="100" align="right">

Multi-player feature has not been implemented because I have a lifelong hatred of multiplayer games. Probably because I never went to kindergarten
and never learned how to play well with the other kids (~‾▿‾)~

Welcome to the dungeon ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Try 'look' to see room descriptions, 'go' to use an exit,
'dig' to create a new room, and 'new' to start the dungeon creation process over again.
Use 'check' to survey your inventory, 'take' to steal loot, 'place' to leave loot behind,
'view' to check your stats, 'spawn' to create monsters, and 'fight' to engage in combat.
